July 3rd 2020:
    DONE:
    - used 'fetch' and 'axios' to make calls to the SMITE API
    - createsession works successfully
    NEED TO DO:
    -hashing should be own function and file where we can import and use with any of the API
     request keywords
    -HTML pages, planned out to see where data will be shown
    -CSS, style the site.
    -Database setup, if call has been made before and hasn't updated, use Database
     entry.

July 4th 2020:
    NEED TO DO:
    - Construct dynamic HTML pages from the players information
    - Have async (async because we want website to continue populating data,
      only after everything is done do we want the info to be added to database)
      functions that add users info they requested to database,
      we use the database data if they make another request for the next 5min
      after 5min we would make another request to API for updated info
    -passport js (jwt java web token) we need authentication
    -html render engine (like pug or handle-bars) so we don't have to statically serrve the HTML files
